# Classification-Mathematical-Image-Problem-Using-CNN
This project will compare performance of Convolutional Neural Network for classficate mathematical image problem. Mathematics problem contained image within image and image with no image. There is 2 up to 7 convolutional layer used in this model with maximum 3 kernel sizes for each layer.

# About Data
Data used a set of mathematical image problem. Data collected by take photo of mathematical image problem and collected image from internet. Image data will extracted to matrix form. Image converted to grayscale and pixel size converted to 500x500.
